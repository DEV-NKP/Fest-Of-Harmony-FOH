The project FOH will be a nature-based project. There will be user control in some of the objects of the project. As it is a nature-based project, the main condition of the project was it should be more genuine and it should look real. There will be some Tents, Carts, A wheel, Stalls etc. Besides these, there will be some sound system of each and every component based on their real-life sounds. Rain and Snow can be added to make nature view more realistic and attractive. There should be a screen in this project to play a game. The game can be controlled by the user and there will be a term of point deduction, winning and losing.
